## About

The purpose of this challenge is to familiarize the student with the Javascript language by creating the code
to a supplied web page that generates random passwords based on user criteria.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:srvidales/password-combobulator.git
```

## Installing

No installation required.

## Usage

Open the [page](https://srvidales.github.io/password-combobulator/) in your favorite browser and click on the "Generate Password" button. You will be asked the length
of the desired password to generate and if it will include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special characters.
Clicking "OK" will include those characters while "Cancel" will not. At the end, the generated password will appear in
the text box.
